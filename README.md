# Claude Code - Pure C Edition

A lightweight, modular implementation of a coding agent that interacts with an Open API compatible API. This is a pure C port of the core functionality from the TypeScript/Node.js Claude Code CLI.

## Features

- **Modular architecture**: Clean separation into focused modules (~2000+ lines total)
- **Core tools**: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep with advanced features
- **Anthropic API integration**: Full support for Claude's Messages API with tool use
- **Efficient**: Direct API calls with libcurl, minimal dependencies
- **Portable**: Standard C11 with POSIX support
- **Theme system**: Kitty-compatible terminal themes for visual customization
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for debugging and audit trails
- **Persistence**: API call history and conversation persistence

### Module Structure

```
src/
├── claude.c         # Main entry point and conversation loop
├── commands.c       # Command-line argument parsing
├── completion.c     # Auto-completion system
├── lineedit.c       # Line editing and input handling
├── logger.c         # Logging infrastructure
├── migrations.c     # Data migration utilities
├── persistence.c    # Data persistence and history
└── tui.c           # Terminal UI and theme system
```

## Dependencies

- **libcurl**: HTTP client for API requests
- **cJSON**: JSON parsing and generation
- **pthread**: Thread support (standard on most systems)
- **POSIX**: File operations, glob, process management

### Installing Dependencies

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install curl cjson
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libcjson-dev build-essential
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum install libcurl-devel cjson-devel gcc make
```

## Building

```bash
cd claude-c
make
```

This will produce a `claude-c` executable in the current directory.

**Optional: Install globally**
```bash
make install
```

This installs to `/usr/local/bin/claude-c` so you can run it from anywhere.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Set your Anthropic API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Running

**One-shot mode (current):**
```bash
./claude-c "your prompt here"
```

**Interactive mode:**
```bash
./claude-c
```

The interactive mode supports:
- Multi-turn conversations
- ESC key interruption: Press ESC to stop the agent during API calls or tool execution
- Slash commands: `/clear`, `/exit`, `/quit`, `/help`, `/add-dir`
- Readline-style editing: Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Alt+B, Alt+F, etc.

### Color Theme Support

The TUI uses **Kitty terminal's theme format** - a simple, dependency-free configuration format. See [docs/COLOR_THEMES.md](docs/COLOR_THEMES.md) for detailed configuration options and available themes.

### Examples

**Simple query:**
```bash
./claude-c "What files are in the current directory?"
```

**Code modification:**
```bash
./claude-c "Read main.c and add error checking to the malloc calls"
```

**Multi-step task:**
```bash
./claude-c "Find all .c files, count the lines in each, and create a summary"
```

## Tools

The C implementation includes these core tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, and Grep. All tools support advanced features like regex patterns, line ranges, and multi-replace operations.



## Comparison to TypeScript Version

See [docs/COMPARISON.md](docs/COMPARISON.md) for a detailed comparison between the C implementation and the official TypeScript version, including feature parity, performance differences, and trade-offs.



## Future Enhancements

See [docs/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md](docs/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) for the detailed roadmap, implementation plans, and estimated timeline for upcoming features.

## Code Structure

See [docs/CODE_STRUCTURE.md](docs/CODE_STRUCTURE.md) for detailed documentation of the modular architecture, including core modules, data structures, memory management patterns, and inter-module communication.

## License

This is a demonstration/educational implementation. Refer to Anthropic's terms of service for API usage.

## Contributing

This is a modular implementation designed for maintainability and extensibility. The codebase is organized into focused modules that make it easy to contribute specific features.

### Development Workflow

1. **Build and test**: `make && make test`
2. **Check dependencies**: `make check-deps`
3. **Install development tools**: `make install-dev`

### Areas for Contribution

- **Interactive TUI mode**: Multi-turn conversation interface
- **Streaming responses**: SSE implementation for real-time responses
- **Parallel execution**: Enable pthread-based concurrent tool execution
- **New tools**: WebFetch, Task, or other specialized tools
- **Performance**: Memory optimization and large file handling

For production use, consider the official TypeScript version with full features.



## Performance

Typical performance on modern hardware:
- CPU: barely registers
- Memory usage: ~10-20MB for typical conversation (modular architecture)

### Performance Notes

- **Modular overhead**: Slightly higher memory usage vs single-file
- **Theme loading**: One-time cost at startup (~5ms)
- **Logging**: Minimal impact when disabled
- **Persistence**: Background saving, non-blocking

## Current Project Status

- Kitty-compatible theme system (300+ themes available)
- Environment-based configuration
- Detailed error messages and debugging support

### 🚧 What's Missing

**Major Features**
- Streaming API responses
- Session persistence across runs

**Infrastructure**
- Configuration file support
- MCP server integration
- Permission management
- Advanced tools (WebFetch, Task)

### 📊 Development Progress

- **Architecture**: 100% - Modular design implemented
- **Core Tools**: 100% - All essential tools working
- **API Integration**: 90% - Missing streaming
- **User Experience**: 95% - Interactive mode, themes, ESC interruption all working
- **Advanced Features**: 40% - Logging/persistence done, missing MCP/hooks

## Security Notes

- API key read from environment (not stored in code)
- No sandboxing: Bash tool has full shell access
- File tools can access any readable/writable file
- Intended for trusted environments only
