- [x] why so many linse between [Assistant] and everything else?

```sh
[Tool: Grep] "User.*printf" in /Users/dunguyen/fgit/claude-c/src
[Assistant]
Let me search for how user input is displayed in non-TUI mode:


[Tool: Grep] "\[User\]" in /Users/dunguyen/fgit/claude-c/src
[Assistant]
Let me check the main non-TUI conversation flow:


[Tool: Read] claude.c:2900-2950
[Assistant]
Let me continue reading the main function to find the non-TUI flow:


[Tool: Read] claude.c:2950-3000

[Tool: Read] claude.c:3000-3050
[Assistant]
Now let me find the `interactive_mode` function:


[Tool: Grep] "interactive_mode" in /Users/dunguyen/fgit/claude-c/src

[Tool: Read] claude.c:2735-2800
```


- [x] why does it fail with failed to resolve path. isn't that path same dir? log debug more when we see this to help fixing the problem. maybe unit test this tool more.
```sh
[Tool: Write] test_todo_simple.c
[Error] Write failed: Failed to resolve path
[Assistant] Let me check the current directory:
```

- [x] can we use ctrl + J for new line. what trick this node js claude used to achieve this?

```

- [ ] large paste fails. how does node js claude prevents that and show X lines pasted.
- [x] pressing Esc will wait for tool to finish but there is no indicator
    - [ ] 'esc' doesn't show interrupted right away.
- [ ] logs are not flushed often?
- [ ] are we logging enough? are all log records go to the same log file?
- [x] all log records should have session id tag. sessions are essential and each run has a new session id
