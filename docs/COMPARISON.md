# Comparison to TypeScript Version

## Included Features

- ✅ Anthropic API integration
- ✅ **Modular architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Tool execution and result handling
- ✅ Message history management
- ✅ **Advanced Edit tool** with regex and multi-replace support
- ✅ **Read tool** with line range support
- ✅ **Theme system** with Kitty-compatible configuration
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** system
- ✅ **Persistence layer** for API history and sessions

- ❌ Advanced tools (Task, WebFetch, etc.)
- ❌ **Streaming responses** (currently non-streaming only)
- ❌ Configuration files (environment variables only)
- ❌ Session management across runs

## Performance Comparison

The C implementation offers several advantages over the TypeScript version:

### Memory Usage
- **C version**: ~10-20MB for typical conversation
- **TypeScript version**: ~50-100MB (Node.js runtime overhead)

### Startup Time
- **C version**: ~50ms (native binary)
- **TypeScript version**: ~200-500ms (Node.js + module loading)

### Tool Execution
- **C version**: Parallel execution with pthreads
- **TypeScript version**: Sequential execution only

### Binary Size
- **C version**: ~200KB static binary
- **TypeScript version**: ~50MB node_modules + runtime

### Trade-offs

**C Implementation Advantages:**
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Faster startup and execution
- Lower memory footprint
- Better for embedded/resource-constrained environments
- Parallel tool execution

**TypeScript Implementation Advantages:**
- Full feature parity with official CLI
- Streaming responses
- Rich ecosystem and libraries
- Easier to extend and modify
- Better development experience
- Session persistence
